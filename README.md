# Object-Detection-Via-Drones
To build a project using computer vision techniques for object detection via drones and display the results on a mobile phone, the general process will consist of several key steps:

    Drone Image Capture: The drone will capture real-time images or videos of the scene using its onboard camera.
    Object Detection: The captured images will be processed to detect objects of interest using computer vision techniques.
    Statistics Extraction: Once objects are detected, we will extract specific statistics such as the number of detected objects, their size, position, and other relevant metrics.
    User Interface (Mobile): The processed data and images will be sent to a mobile application where the user can view the results and interact with the system.

Key Components and Technologies:

    Computer Vision (CV): Use pre-trained models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), MobileNet, or Detectron2 for object detection.
    Drone Communication: Use a protocol like DJI SDK (for DJI drones) or PX4 for communicating with the drone and getting video feed.
    Mobile UI: Use frameworks like Flutter or React Native for building a mobile app to display results.
    Cloud/Local Processing: Optionally, you can run object detection on the drone directly or stream data to a server/cloud for processing.

Below is a Python script that illustrates how you might implement such a system. This will primarily focus on the object detection part using a drone camera (for example, via streaming) and sending the results to a mobile UI.
Python Code Example

    Drone Stream Handling: Capture video feed from the drone.
    Object Detection Using OpenCV and YOLO: Process each frame and detect objects.
    Sending Results to Mobile UI: Stream data to a mobile app using a web server (Flask or FastAPI).

1. Drone Video Feed and Object Detection (YOLO)

The first step is to set up object detection on the images streamed by the drone.

import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load YOLO pre-trained weights and configuration
def load_yolo_model():
    net = cv2.dnn.readNet("yolov3.weights", "yolov3.cfg")
    layer_names = net.getLayerNames()
    output_layers = [layer_names[i - 1] for i in net.getUnconnectedOutLayers()]
    return net, output_layers

# Process video feed from the drone camera
def process_video_stream(video_stream_url):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_stream_url)
    net, output_layers = load_yolo_model()

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        # Detect objects in the frame
        height, width, channels = frame.shape
        blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)
        net.setInput(blob)
        outputs = net.forward(output_layers)

        # Extract object information
        boxes, confidences, class_ids = [], [], []
        for out in outputs:
            for detection in out:
                scores = detection[5:]
                class_id = np.argmax(scores)
                confidence = scores[class_id]
                if confidence > 0.5:  # Set confidence threshold
                    center_x = int(detection[0] * width)
                    center_y = int(detection[1] * height)
                    w = int(detection[2] * width)
                    h = int(detection[3] * height)
                    x = int(center_x - w / 2)
                    y = int(center_y - h / 2)

                    boxes.append([x, y, w, h])
                    confidences.append(float(confidence))
                    class_ids.append(class_id)

        # Non-maxima suppression to remove duplicates
        indices = cv2.dnn.NMSBoxes(boxes, confidences, 0.5, 0.4)

        # Draw bounding boxes
        for i in indices.flatten():
            x, y, w, h = boxes[i]
            cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

        # Show the frame with bounding boxes
        cv2.imshow("Drone Object Detection", frame)

        # Exit on pressing 'q'
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Example Usage
video_stream_url = 'http://192.168.10.1:8080/video'  # Example URL for drone video stream
process_video_stream(video_stream_url)

2. Sending Results to Mobile UI (Flask Web Server)

Now, we will create a simple Flask server to stream the results (bounding box positions, object statistics) to the mobile app. The mobile app can use this data to display on a user interface.

from flask import Flask, jsonify, Response
import cv2

app = Flask(__name__)

# Global variable to store the latest frame and object data
latest_frame = None
object_statistics = {}

# This endpoint will serve the video stream to the mobile app
def generate():
    global latest_frame
    while True:
        if latest_frame is not None:
            ret, jpeg = cv2.imencode('.jpg', latest_frame)
            if ret:
                frame = jpeg.tobytes()
                yield (b'--frame\r\n'
                       b'Content-Type: image/jpeg\r\n\r\n' + frame + b'\r\n\r\n')

# Route for streaming the video
@app.route('/video_feed')
def video_feed():
    return Response(generate(), mimetype='multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=frame')

# API to get object statistics
@app.route('/object_stats')
def get_object_stats():
    return jsonify(object_statistics)

def process_video_stream_for_flask(video_stream_url):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_stream_url)
    net, output_layers = load_yolo_model()

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        # Detect objects in the frame
        height, width, channels = frame.shape
        blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)
        net.setInput(blob)
        outputs = net.forward(output_layers)

        # Extract object information
        boxes, confidences, class_ids = [], [], []
        for out in outputs:
            for detection in out:
                scores = detection[5:]
                class_id = np.argmax(scores)
                confidence = scores[class_id]
                if confidence > 0.5:  # Set confidence threshold
                    center_x = int(detection[0] * width)
                    center_y = int(detection[1] * height)
                    w = int(detection[2] * width)
                    h = int(detection[3] * height)
                    x = int(center_x - w / 2)
                    y = int(center_y - h / 2)

                    boxes.append([x, y, w, h])
                    confidences.append(float(confidence))
                    class_ids.append(class_id)

        # Non-maxima suppression to remove duplicates
        indices = cv2.dnn.NMSBoxes(boxes, confidences, 0.5, 0.4)

        # Store object statistics
        object_statistics = {
            "detected_objects": len(indices),
            "object_positions": [boxes[i] for i in indices.flatten()]
        }

        # Draw bounding boxes
        for i in indices.flatten():
            x, y, w, h = boxes[i]
            cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

        global latest_frame
        latest_frame = frame  # Update the latest frame

    cap.release()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    video_stream_url = 'http://192.168.10.1:8080/video'  # Replace with your drone stream URL
    # Start video processing in the background
    from threading import Thread
    Thread(target=process_video_stream_for_flask, args=(video_stream_url,)).start()
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, threaded=True)

3. Mobile App (Flutter/React Native)

Your mobile application (built using Flutter or React Native) will need to:

    Connect to the Flask server to receive the live video feed (/video_feed).
    Fetch object statistics via an API (/object_stats) to display on the UI.

For example, in Flutter, you can use the http package to interact with the /object_stats endpoint and display the results.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  Future<void> fetchObjectStats() async {
    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('http://<flask_server_ip>:5000/object_stats'));
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      print('Object Stats: ${response.body}');
    } else {
      throw Exception('Failed to load object statistics');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title

Creating a system that uses computer vision techniques to detect objects with drones and provides specific statistics in a mobile phone interface is a complex project, but I can guide you through the main components involved and provide a Python-based approach to get started. Below, I outline a basic structure of how you could implement this project.
Key Components:

    Drone Setup: You'll need a drone capable of carrying a camera (e.g., a DJI drone or a custom setup using a Raspberry Pi or similar with a camera module).
    Computer Vision (CV) for Object Detection: Using a CV model (like YOLO, MobileNet, or Faster R-CNN), you can detect objects in real-time.
    Mobile App for Displaying Statistics: You can build a mobile app (using Flutter or React Native) that receives data from the drone (e.g., object types, position, distance) and displays this on the UI.
    Data Transfer: Communication between the drone (with the object detection model) and the mobile app (using HTTP requests or WebSocket for real-time communication).

High-Level Steps:

    Set up the drone to capture video and stream it for processing.
    Process the video feed with computer vision to detect objects in real-time.
    Calculate statistics about the detected objects (e.g., object count, distance, size).
    Transfer the data to the mobile app for display.

Python Code for Drone and Object Detection (on the Drone Side)

For the purpose of this example, we will use OpenCV for object detection, and assume that the drone streams video that is processed by the onboard computer (e.g., a Raspberry Pi or similar).
1. Object Detection with OpenCV and YOLO (You Only Look Once)

First, let's set up object detection using YOLO, a popular real-time object detection system.

import cv2
import numpy as np
import time
import requests

# Load YOLO
yolo_net = cv2.dnn.readNet("yolov3.weights", "yolov3.cfg")
layer_names = yolo_net.getLayerNames()
output_layers = [layer_names[i-1] for i in yolo_net.getUnconnectedOutLayers()]

# Load COCO names (list of objects YOLO can detect)
with open("coco.names", "r") as f:
    classes = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]

# Drone video capture (can be from a local camera, RTSP stream, or direct drone feed)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("drone_video_stream_url")  # Replace with your video stream URL

# Function to process frame and detect objects
def detect_objects(frame):
    # Convert the frame to blob for YOLO
    blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)
    yolo_net.setInput(blob)
    outputs = yolo_net.forward(output_layers)

    # Parse the detections and calculate object stats
    height, width, channels = frame.shape
    class_ids = []
    confidences = []
    boxes = []
    statistics = {"objects_detected": 0, "object_details": []}

    for output in outputs:
        for detection in output:
            scores = detection[5:]
            class_id = np.argmax(scores)
            confidence = scores[class_id]
            
            # Only consider objects with confidence > 0.5
            if confidence > 0.5:
                statistics["objects_detected"] += 1
                center_x = int(detection[0] * width)
                center_y = int(detection[1] * height)
                w = int(detection[2] * width)
                h = int(detection[3] * height)

                # Store object details
                statistics["object_details"].append({
                    "object": classes[class_id],
                    "confidence": confidence,
                    "coordinates": (center_x, center_y, w, h)
                })

                # Draw bounding box
                cv2.rectangle(frame, (center_x - w // 2, center_y - h // 2), 
                              (center_x + w // 2, center_y + h // 2), (0, 255, 0), 2)
                cv2.putText(frame, classes[class_id], (center_x - w // 2, center_y - h // 2 - 10), 
                            cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (0, 255, 0), 2)
    return frame, statistics

# Main loop to capture frames and process them
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Detect objects in the frame
    processed_frame, stats = detect_objects(frame)
    
    # Send the statistics to the mobile app (HTTP request to the app server)
    requests.post("http://your_mobile_app_server_url/update", json=stats)
    
    # Display the frame (optional, for debugging purposes)
    cv2.imshow("Drone Object Detection", processed_frame)

    # Exit on 'q'
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Explanation:

    YOLO Object Detection: We load the YOLO model and use it to detect objects in each frame of the drone video feed.
    Statistics: After detecting an object, we calculate statistics such as the object type, confidence, and coordinates of the bounding box.
    Communication: The statistics are sent to a mobile app via an HTTP POST request. The mobile app will need to have an API endpoint that accepts these statistics and updates the UI.
    Real-Time Detection: Each frame of the video is processed in real-time.

2. Mobile App (Client Side)

The mobile app will receive the object detection statistics and display them in a user-friendly format. For simplicity, assume that you're using a framework like Flutter or React Native to build the mobile app.
Example with Flutter (using HTTP request to fetch data from the drone)

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ObjectDetectionScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ObjectDetectionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ObjectDetectionScreenState createState() => _ObjectDetectionScreenState();
}

class _ObjectDetectionScreenState extends State<ObjectDetectionScreen> {
  String _status = "Waiting for data...";
  List<dynamic> _objectDetails = [];

  void _fetchObjectStats() async {
    try {
      final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('http://your_mobile_app_server_url/update'));
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        final data = jsonDecode(response.body);
        setState(() {
          _status = "Objects Detected: ${data['objects_detected']}";
          _objectDetails = data['object_details'];
        });
      } else {
        setState(() {
          _status = "Failed to fetch data.";
        });
      }
    } catch (e) {
      setState(() {
        _status = "Error: $e";
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _fetchObjectStats();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Drone Object Detection'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            Text(_status, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18)),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Expanded(
              child: ListView.builder(
                itemCount: _objectDetails.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  final obj = _objectDetails[index];
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(obj['object']),
                    subtitle: Text('Confidence: ${obj['confidence']}'),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

Explanation:

    Mobile UI: This Flutter app fetches statistics about detected objects and displays them in a list view. It sends an HTTP request to the drone server and updates the UI accordingly.
    Statistics Display: The object details (e.g., type, confidence) are displayed as a list of items in the mobile interface.

3. Drone Communication Setup

You need a server or a cloud-based system to communicate between the drone and mobile app. The drone sends object detection statistics through an HTTP POST or WebSocket connection, and the mobile app listens for updates.

Option 1: HTTP Server with Flask (for example)

You can set up a simple Flask server to handle requests and forward the data to the mobile app:

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/update', methods=['POST'])
def update_stats():
    data = request.get_json()
    # Process data, store or forward as needed
    return jsonify({"message": "Data received successfully", "status": "OK"}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

Conclusion:

    Drone-side: This uses computer vision with YOLO to detect objects in real-time and sends the statistics to a mobile app via HTTP.
    Mobile App: The Flutter app listens for these updates and displays the object detection statistics.
    Scalability: This architecture can be expanded with more complex models, additional sensors, or even real-time tracking using GPS or other methods.

By combining drone hardware, computer vision, and mobile app development, you can create a comprehensive solution for detecting and tracking objects in the real world!
